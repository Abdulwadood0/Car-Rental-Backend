# 🚘 Car Rental Backend API

This is the backend of the Car Rental Web App. It handles user authentication, car and booking management, and integrates with Moyassar for payments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB (hosted on MongoDB Atlas)
- JWT Authentication (with HTTP-only cookies)
- Cloudinary (for image uploads and storage)
- Moyassar API (for payment processing)
- AWS EC2 (deployment)

## 🔐 Features

- Role-based JWT authentication (user/admin)
- Secure HTTP-only cookie sessions
- CRUD for vehicles and reservations
- Cloudinary image upload support
- Moyassar API payment integration
- Error handling with consistent API responses
- Scheduled cron job runs every 5 minutes to delete reservations that are still unpaid and were created more than 1 hour ago
- Environment-based config for production and development

## 🧪 API Routes (Highlights)

- `POST /api/auth/signup` – signup a new user  
- `POST /api/auth/login` – Login and get JWT  
- `GET /api/cars` – List all cars  
- `POST /api/cars` – Add a car (admin only)  
- `POST /api/reservation` – Create a booking

## 🌐 Deployment Details

The backend is deployed on an **AWS EC2** instance using the following setup:

- **Ubuntu** server on EC2
- SSH access using private key (`.pem`)
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed
- **PM2** used to run the server in the background (`pm2 start server.js`)
- **NGINX** used as a reverse proxy from port 80 to 5000
- **MongoDB Atlas** as the production database

#### NGINX Example Config:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-ec2-ip-or-domain;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

#### PM2 Setup:

```bash
pm2 start server.js --name "car-rental-api"
pm2 save
```

This ensures the backend stays running after crashes or reboots.
